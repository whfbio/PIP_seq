# PIP-seq: Figure Reproducibility Code

This repository contains the analysis code used to generate figures for the manuscript:

**“Spatially Guided In Vivo Single-Cell Functional Genomics of Postnatal Heart.”** :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

The code is organized by figure and includes scripts written in **R** and **Python**.

## Repository structure

- `Figure1/` – scripts and assets to reproduce Figure 1
- `Figure2/` – scripts and assets to reproduce Figure 2
- `Figure3/` – scripts and assets to reproduce Figure 3
- `Figure4/` – scripts and assets to reproduce Figure 4
- `Figure5/` – scripts and assets to reproduce Figure 5
- `Figure6/` – scripts and assets to reproduce Figure 6 (PIP-seq analysis)

## System requirements

- **OS:** Linux or macOS :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Tested with:**  
  - Python **3.9.10** :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
